# JavaFX FileEncrypter Application

### Frontend
This GUI app has a drag and drop feature, where there is a file area,
which makes it very intuitive of how to decrypt and encrypt files!

### Security notes
Note that the security of the encryption is not that tight.
I think that if you really wanted to decrypt someone's files,
you could with ease without knowing the users password (encryption key)
