# JavaFX FileEncrypter Application

### Frontend
This GUI app has a drag and drop feature, where there are two file areas,
which makes the action of encrypting and decrypting files very intuitive.

### Security notes
Note that the security of the encryption is not that tight.
I think that if you really wanted to decrypt someone's files,
you could do that with ease, without knowing the user's password (encryption key).
